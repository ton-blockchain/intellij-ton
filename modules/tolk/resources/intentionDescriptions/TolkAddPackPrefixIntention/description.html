Adds a pack prefix to struct declarations based on CRC32 hash of the struct name.

<p>
    This intention automatically generates a 32-bit pack prefix for struct declarations
    that don't already have one. The prefix is calculated using CRC32 hash of the struct name
    and formatted as a hexadecimal number (e.g., (0x12345678)).
</p>

<p>
    Examples:
</p>
<pre><code>
// Before
struct MyStruct {
    field1: int32;
    field2: bits32;
}

// After applying intention
struct (0x12345678) MyStruct {
    field1: int32;
    field2: bits32;
}
</code></pre>

<p>
    The generated prefix is deterministic — the same struct name will always produce
    the same CRC32 hash, ensuring consistency across different codebases and compilations.
